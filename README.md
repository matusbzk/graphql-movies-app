# GraphQL example app

This application was created as my attempt to get into GraphQL. It started as simple application based on .NET Core and then I have created a GraphQL server over it.

No GraphQL stuff is currently in master branch, all of that stuff is in GraphQL branch, so you can see a diff between these branches as all the work needed to implement GraphQL server. Almost no frontend runs on the actual GraphQL server, but the server is fully functional.
